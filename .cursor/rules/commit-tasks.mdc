# Task Commit Conventions

## One branch per task

Each task from TODOS.md must be developed in a **separate branch**. Do not mix multiple tasks in one branch.

**Workflow:**
1. Create branch from `main`: `git checkout -b day-N-task-X.Y` (e.g. `day-1-task-1.2a`)
2. Implement the task
3. Commit with the message format below
4. Merge to `main` (via PR or direct merge) only after the task passes review

## One commit per task

Each task must be committed in a **separate commit**. Do not combine multiple tasks into one commit.

## Commit message format

Use conventional commits with the pattern:

```
feat: day N task X.Y
```

Where:
- **N** = day number (e.g. 1, 2, 3)
- **X.Y** = task identifier from TODOS.md (e.g. 1.1, 1.2, 1.2a, 1.3, …)

### Examples (Day 1)

- `feat: day 1 task 1.1` — Create frontend Next.js
- `feat: day 1 task 1.2` — Create backend Nest.js
- `feat: day 1 task 1.2a` — Backend modules structure
- `feat: day 1 task 1.3` — Add shared types
- `feat: day 1 task 1.4` — Create Supabase project
- … (continue for 1.5–1.13 as per TODOS.md)

## Scope: Day 1 only today

Today's scope is **Day 1 only**. Do not implement or commit Day 2+ tasks until Day 1 is complete. Workflow tasks (1.W1, 1.W2) may be included in Day 1 scope.

## Gitignore is crucial

Keep the repository clean by ensuring:

- **Never commit** `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env` (secrets), or build artifacts
- Each package/app (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `shared/`) has a `.gitignore` that ignores its dependencies and output
- Add `.gitignore` entries as soon as you add new generated paths (e.g. new build output, coverage, IDE config)
- If you introduce a new package or build step, add its output to `.gitignore` in the same commit

A clean git status (no `dist/`, `node_modules/` in changes) keeps the repo maintainable and avoids accidental commits of build artifacts.

## Pass review before commit

Before committing each task:

1. Run local tests (if applicable)
2. Verify the task meets its "How to test locally" criteria in TODOS.md
3. Address any lint or type errors
4. Ensure the change passes review without issues
5. Ensure no build artifacts or secrets would be committed (check `git status`)

Commit only when the task is complete and verified.
